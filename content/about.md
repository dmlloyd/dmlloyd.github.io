### About me...

Hi! My name is David Lloyd. I'm an engineer at IBM who works on a wide variety of Java-, Quarkus-, Wildfly-, and JBoss-related projects. You can usually find me on [the Quarkus Zulip instance](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com) or on [Libera IRC](https://libera.chat/) as `dmlloyd` in various Java- and compiler-related channels.
