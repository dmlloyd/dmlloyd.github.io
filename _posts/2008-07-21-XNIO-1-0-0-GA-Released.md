 The first GA release of XNIO is now available. There is only one substantial fix in this release. The standalone API did not present a way to close ChannelSource and Connector instances that were created via an Xnio instance. This has been fixed, and I think the wait has been long enough.

Find the release at the [downloads page]("http://www.jboss.org/xnio/downloads/" "") of the [XNIO project website]("http://www.jboss.org/xnio/" "") . Also check out the [online documentation]("http://docs.jboss.org/xnio/1.0/api/index.html" "") .
