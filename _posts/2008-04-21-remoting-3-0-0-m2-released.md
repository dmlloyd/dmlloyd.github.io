 Remoting 3.0.0\-M2 is released. I've got the jars uploaded in a ZIP file, but you'll want to check out the project and look in the "samples/" for samples of using the standalone API. The Microcontainer integration is scheduled for M3, so standalone is pretty much all that you can really play with at the moment. Report bugs in JIRA as "found in: 3.0.0\-M2" and "fix for: 3.0.0\-M3" to make sure I see them.

The version "M2" means "Milestone 2". The API is more or less stable, but until the first Beta release it is possible that the API (and the basic protocols) will change in an incompatible way. I do, however, encourage you to download and play around with it.

You can <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/downloads/">download the JARs here</a>, and as always the sources are available via <a href="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossremoting/remoting3/trunk/">anonymous SVN</a>(and <a href="https://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbossremoting/remoting3/trunk/">committer SVN</a>).
