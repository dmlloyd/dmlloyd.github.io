 XNIO 1.2.0.CR1 is available for download at <a href="http://www.jboss.org/xnio/downloads/">the XNIO project download page</a>, sporting lots of cool new features, like:

* The ability to switch between blocking and non\-blocking modes

* Wrapper Input/OutputStreams for channels

* JMX monitoring

* A restructured API/SPI system

* A one\-time server API (for services like IRC DCC and FTP that need to create one\-shot server sockets)

* The ability to change a server's bind address(es) after it has been started ...not to mention several performance improvements and code and documentation cleanup changes as well. Check out the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/xnio/1.2.0.CR1/api/">API Javadocs</a>as well. Enjoy!
