 JBoss Marshalling is an alternative serialization API that fixes many of the problems found in the JDK serialization API while remaining fully compatible with `java.io.Serializable` and its relatives, and adds several new tunable parameters and additional features, all of which are pluggable via factory configuration (externalizers, class/instance lookup tables, class resolution, and object replacement, to name a few).

This project doesn't yet have an official home, but you can view the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/river/1.0.0.GA/api/">online API documentation right here</a>, and the project is available for download at <a href="http://repository.jboss.org/jboss/marshalling/1.0.0.GA/lib/">this location within the JBoss repository</a>.
