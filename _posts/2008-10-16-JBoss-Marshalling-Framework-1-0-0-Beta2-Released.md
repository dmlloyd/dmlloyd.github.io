 I'm pleased to announce that the second beta of the new marshalling framework has arrived. The API is pretty much final at this point; now it's just a bug quest before the first CR is released in a couple weeks. For more information about the features of the framework, please see [the original Beta1 announcement]("http://dmlloyd.blogspot.com/2008/10/jboss-marshalling-framework-100beta1.html" "") .

Download the JARs from [the repository]("http://repository.jboss.org/jboss/marshalling/1.0.0.Beta2/" "") . The documentation is available [here at the JBoss docs site]("http://docs.jboss.org/river/1.0.0.Beta2/api" "") . Please report any bugs [in the JBoss Marshalling bug tracker]("https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBMAR" "") .

Many thanks to Ron Sigal, author of the Java serializaiton-compatible module, and the one who flushed out <strike>some</strike> <strike>most</strike> all of the bugs from the Beta1 River protocol implementation that were fixed in this version.
