 I'm pleased to announce that the second beta of the new marshalling framework has arrived. The API is pretty much final at this point; now it's just a bug quest before the first CR is released in a couple weeks. For more information about the features of the framework, please see <a href="http://dmlloyd.blogspot.com/2008/10/jboss-marshalling-framework-100beta1.html">the original Beta1 announcement</a>.

Download the JARs from <a href="http://repository.jboss.org/jboss/marshalling/1.0.0.Beta2/">the repository</a>. The documentation is available <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/river/1.0.0.Beta2/api">here at the JBoss docs site</a>. Please report any bugs <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBMAR">in the JBoss Marshalling bug tracker</a>.

Many thanks to Ron Sigal, author of the Java serializaiton\-compatible module, and the one who flushed out <strike>some</strike> <strike>most</strike> all of the bugs from the Beta1 River protocol implementation that were fixed in this version.
