 XNIO 1.1.0.GA is available [on the XNIO downloads page](https://www.jboss.org/xnio/downloads/ "") . Not much change since 1.1.0.CR1. Just a Javadoc update, and one interface rename: `TcpClient` has been renamed to `TcpChannelSource` (see [XNIO-55](https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/XNIO-55 "") for more information). Also see the [online Javadocs](http://docs.jboss.org/xnio/1.1.0.GA/api/index.html "") for usage information.

Have fun!
