 This is the last Beta before the CR (candidate for release) series. As always, the download is available at <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/downloads">the Remoting download page</a>. This release differs from Beta1 in several ways, not the least of which is the more complete distribution, which includes source JARs and API Javadoc as well as the Remoting JARs themselves. View the <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12312965&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=10031&amp;Create=Create">release notes</a>for the full list of differences.

The online Javadoc is <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/remoting/3.0.0.Beta2/api/">available here</a>. Also, there are <a href="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossremoting/remoting3/tags/3.0.0.Beta2/samples/src/main/java/org/jboss/remoting/samples/simple/">a few code samples</a>available in the Subversion repository. Please feel free to report bugs in <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBREM">the Remoting JIRA bug tracker</a>, making sure to mark the proper version when doing so.
