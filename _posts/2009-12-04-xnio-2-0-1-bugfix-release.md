 I've uploaded a minor bugfix release for XNIO 2.0.0. It fixes a selector wakeup bug, as well as a minor API bug and a minor optimization for blocking I/O with the NIO\-based provider.

All users of 2.0.0 are encouraged to update to 2.0.1. The release is available on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/xnio/downloads">the download page</a>.
