 It's official... I've checked in the first cut of the Java Serialization from-scratch implementation. <strike>It's not complete yet - it doesn't even pass all the tests</strike> (Update: everything works now - check it out from SVN and try it!) - but I expect that it will be fully functional by the 1.1.0 release (and, coincidentally, by the time I will be giving [my JBoss Marshalling talk at TSSJS]("http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/architecture.html?track=NL-476&ad=684048&Offer=JSemtssunsc112h&asrc=EM_UTC_5542644&uid=7850586#DLloydMarsh" "") ). Also in progress is Ron Sigal's JBoss Serialization implementation, which should be in 1.2.0 at the latest.

Look for the 1.1.0.GA release the week of February 23rd.
