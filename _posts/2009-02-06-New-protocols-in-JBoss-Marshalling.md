 It's official... I've checked in the first cut of the Java Serialization from\-scratch implementation. <strike>It's not complete yet \- it doesn't even pass all the tests</strike> (Update: everything works now \- check it out from SVN and try it!) \- but I expect that it will be fully functional by the 1.1.0 release (and, coincidentally, by the time I will be giving <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/architecture.html?track=NL-476&amp;ad=684048&amp;Offer=JSemtssunsc112h&amp;asrc=EM_UTC_5542644&amp;uid=7850586#DLloydMarsh">my JBoss Marshalling talk at TSSJS</a>). Also in progress is Ron Sigal's JBoss Serialization implementation, which should be in 1.2.0 at the latest.

Look for the 1.1.0.GA release the week of February 23rd.
