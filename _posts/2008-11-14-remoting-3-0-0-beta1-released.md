 The download is available at <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/downloads/">the Remoting download page</a>. The structure is similar to the milestone releases; though it may be changing slightly for the next Beta. I expect that there will be at most one more Beta, followed by a CR series.

Javadoc is available online at <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/remoting/3.0.0.Beta1/api/">the docs site</a>; bugs should be reported <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/project/ViewProject.jspa?pid=10031">in the bug tracker</a>(make sure you report the bug in the 3.0.0.Beta1 release). See <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/">the project page</a>for more information.
