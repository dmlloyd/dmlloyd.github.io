 The download is available at [the Remoting download page]("http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/downloads/" "") . The structure is similar to the milestone releases; though it may be changing slightly for the next Beta. I expect that there will be at most one more Beta, followed by a CR series.

Javadoc is available online at [the docs site]("http://docs.jboss.org/remoting/3.0.0.Beta1/api/" "") ; bugs should be reported [in the bug tracker]("https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/project/ViewProject.jspa?pid=10031" "") (make sure you report the bug in the 3.0.0.Beta1 release). See [the project page]("http://www.jboss.org/jbossremoting/" "") for more information.
